# The Overture Tool Language Board

This repository should remain empty: its primary purpose it the issues tracker that is used by the Overture Language Board.  For more information, see the main [Overture webpage](http://overturetool.org) or look at the [Overture community description](http://wiki.overturetool.org/index.php?title=The_Community) and the [Language Board process](http://wiki.overturetool.org/index.php/Language_Board_Process) pages for specific details.  (Note that the last two pages will move to the main webpage in due course.)

Documentation, including the VDM 10 Language Reference Manual, can be found in the [documentation repository](https://github.com/overturetool/documentation).
